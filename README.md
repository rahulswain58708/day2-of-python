# 🐍 Day 2 - Python Practice: Variables, Data Types, Typecasting & Operators

Today I focused on building strong fundamentals in Python. These basics are the building blocks for more advanced programming and AI development.

## ✅ Topics Covered

- **Variables** – Creating and storing values
- **Data Types** – `int`, `float`, `str`
- **Typecasting** – Converting data types (`int()`, `float()`, `str()`)
- **Input Function** – Using `input()` to accept user data
- **Arithmetic Operators** – `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
- **Execution Order** – Understanding how Python executes step-by-step

### 1. Name & Age Printer
Input name and age, and print a message.

### 2. Typecasting Input Addition
Take two numbers as input (strings), convert to integers, and add.

### 3. Data Type Checker
Detect and print the data type after input and typecasting.

### 4. Arithmetic Operations
Take two numbers and perform all 5 basic arithmetic operations.

### 5. Swap Without Temp Variable
Swap two numbers using arithmetic logic without a third variable.

### 6. Marks Challenge
Take input for 3 subjects and calculate:
